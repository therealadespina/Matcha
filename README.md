Matcha - This project is about creating a dating website (application).
 
# INTRODUCE

## Chapter I

This second millennium has forever changed and upheld the habits and manners of Internet. The choice is guided by technologies, and room for luck is increasingly smaller.
Human relationships, seed of any modern society are increasingly created artificially by
meeting sites algorithms and social networks, between people that match to some very
precise criteria.
Yes, romanticism is dead, and Victor Hugo is probably spinning in his grave.
Dating websites are a market of love. One can “prospect” and “present” him or herself
with the goal of meeting the person with whom he or she will develop a relationship. If
most meeting sites known to the public have a widespread audience, some sites, following
a logical niche strat- egy have specialized in some very specific domain, some are very
indecent.
Hairy guys for example, will find love on BearWWW, Goths will go to Gothicmatch,
and wizards (and other pentacles lovers) on Witchdating.
Some sites will be different, such as 7OrBetter.com 1 or seekingmillionaire.com.
